Please indicate whether you disagree or agree with the following statements: - I am familiar with the term ""gene editing""","Thank you again for agreeing to participate in this survey. We would like to begin by asking you some questions about your understanding of a few terms.

 

 

Please indicate whether you disagree or agree with the following statements: - I am familiar with the term ""gene drive""","Before we go further, we will first define a few terms. 

 


	Genetic modification is the process of altering an organism’s genome (its full set of genes) by inserting genes from one organism into another. 
	Gene editing is the process of using a tool that works like a pair of scissors to make edits in an organism’s genes—unlike genetic modification, these edits are targeted to a specific location in the organism’s genome.
	Gene drives are a technique that ensures that an edit is inherited by the next generation and eventually spreads through that organism’s population. 





Based on these definitions, would you say that these three processes—genetic modification, gene editing, and gene drives—seem similar to each other, or different from each other?",Please feel free to explain your reasoning:,Please tell us your “gut feeling” or comfort level with regard to this change to tomatoes:,Please feel free to explain your reasoning:,"Now, what if it were a sweetness gene from a sugar beet, not an heirloom tomato that was used. 
 

How do you feel about this altered version of the application?",Please feel free to explain your reasoning:,Please tell us your “gut feeling” or comfort level with regard to this change to dairy cattle:,Please feel free to explain your reasoning:,"Now, what if this approach were used to increase the milk-producing capacity of the next generation of cattle. 

 

How do you feel about this altered version of the application?",Please feel free to explain your reasoning.,"Please tell us your ""gut feeling"" or comfort level with regard to this change to wheat:",Please feel free to explain your reasoning.,"Now, what if instead of a staple crop like wheat, this technique was applied to a less important crop like blueberries.
 

 How do you feel about this altered version of the application?",Please feel free to explain your reasoning:,"Next, we’d like to ask you a couple questions about some tradeoffs involving gene-edited crops.

 

First, some researchers think that growing gene-edited crops could be used to significantly reduce the volume of pesticides used on farms. This is because those crops would be edited to be resistant to specific pests, and so farms could avoid general spraying.



 

Assuming scientists are right about this, which of the following choices between production of gene-edited crops and pesticide use do you prefer?",Please feel free to add any comments that you had on this question about tradeoffs between gene-edited crops and pesticide use:,"Some researchers also think that use of gene-edited crops could benefit the conservation of biodiversity. This is because edited versions might have higher crop yields per area of land than non-edited ones. Therefore, less land (e.g., forest habitat) would be converted to agriculture.

I don’t feel not only is it unnecessary to genetically change a cow purely of the dangers of a horn but it could be preventable. Any animals with the right training can prevent such attacks or behaviours to occur. Cows as like other animals do recognize tone of voice, their name (Presumptuously after been repeated a certain word for an X period of time) and ultimately make a decision. The concept of genetic is interesting and would be cool, but as anything there may be a slight change in food chain or something of the sort",Uncomfortable,"I think we’re fine with the state of where cows are. Cows as like people have imperfections, you can’t expect all cows to have a bigger capacity of carrying dairy) and even if hypothetically all cows could conventionally have bigger capacity and no cows are lower than the new norm. i dont think it’s necessary?

Tomatoes are not supposed to be perfectly round with no blemishes like the tasteless ""hot house"" variety. I don't understand this perception at all. Ditto for ""seedless"" watermelons which irks me more than anything. So we now find only ""seedless"" watermelons in grocery stores now because someone clown thinks that it's an inconvenience to have to find seeds in our fruit. A fruit is basically an ovary. It's supposed to have seeds! There is nothing wrong with that! Incidentally, only in North America do I find this be true. When I travel to Europe or the Caribbean, I get the real thing--not some fake imitation.

Again, here we go trying to modify nature for OUR convenience. To me, it is just WRONG to subject an animal to this kind of unnecessary torture. I also feel that the people who do this (including vets!) derive some sort of sick pleasure out of it. There are solutions to this problem but we just can't be bothered. Horns can be ""foamed"" or the animals could simply be separated--but apparently that would cost too much so it would be easier to torture them by cauterizing (or ""surgically removing"" as you say) their horns at its root when they're young. And God forbid and anesthetic be used as that, too, would ""cost too much"". After all, it's just an animal (who has no rights), right? NOTE: I am a male meat eater. I know that animals have to be slaughtered for us to eat them. I just don't think that torturing them at any time before they are slaughtered is necessary. Only SICK minds do this! Same goes with branding an animal. Is it really necessary to brand an animal nowadays that horse and cattle ""stealing"" are not as prevalent as they were a century or two ago? Again, I think that any sadistic loser who does this to an animal deserves to be bent over, tightly stabilized, and branded in the buttocks multiple times just to see what it feels like.

Strongly agree,Agree,Neutral,Very different,"With GM you could take an apple and insert the genes of a plum, getting a fruit that was shaped like an apple, was the colour and consistency of a plum and had seeds like an apple.  Thereby making a totally different fruit if you then did GD to make the changes continue through the generations
With GE you could insert a gene that changed the colour of the apple but everything else remained the same. Again you would have to then do GD to ensure that the change continued through the following generations.
With GD this would mean that the changes from the GE modification would continue on from generation to generation.
",Uncomfortable,I am generally uncomfortable with the idea of GMO.  I do see that there can be benefits.  For example making a crop drought resistant or resistant to certain diseases that can decimate crops.  My concern is that when we change something at a genetic level we may not realize harm that may be done generations (of the changed item or to the people/animal that are involved in any way) to come.,Uncomfortable,As in my comments before I feel that we may be tampering in ways that will come back to bite us in generations to come.,Very uncomfortable,"I just don't feel comfortable genetically modifying animals to suite our needs.  We really should be modifying our behaviours to accommodate them.  In the end we are using them for our needs and in the case of beef cattle, in the end, killing them for food.  Why should we should we breed out or GM the dairy cattle just because it's something that we want?",Neither comfortable nor uncomfortable,It is something that I am on the fence about.  I certainly understand the reasoning and the need for this.  I could argue that breast feeding for infants is better than formula so we should GM a certain group of women so that they could be continuous breast feeders and thus create a new niche in the modern day workforce for wet nurses.  They could start breast feeding at puberty and if we did the GM right they could continue on well beyond menopause.  Just a thought.  Run it by the dairy cows and see what they think.,Uncomfortable,"As before, I am concerned about long term affects to  those eating this wheat.

Agree,Agree,Disagree,Somewhat similar,"They are similar in that they are all dealing with the genes.  But they are different in that it seems to be a 1-2-3 process.  The only way I can explain it - is when they create 1 type of apple from two other types.  They take parts of one and parts of the other and that is the ""modification"".  Now this new apple has grown and they now take it and make an edit to let's say make is more resistant to an apple disease = editing. Then when they are happy with the results one last change is done so when this new apple grows on trees these changes will be continued in the next generations = gene drives.  ",Very comfortable,"Oh Please do it!! Do it now!!  When I was a child and into my teens I lived in a house with a huge vegetable garden.  We grew our own carrots, beans, and a whole bunch of other stuff including a number of different tomatoes,  Biting into one of those tomatoes right off the vine - omg - heaven on earth - the taste, the texture, the smell - complete heaven on earth.  Then you go to the grocery store and pick one up there.  The look is similar but that is where it ends. Almost tasteless, no smell.  This childhood of mine was over 50 years ago and I have not had access to a garden since then.  I am stuck with these tasteless, smell-less tomato wanna-be.  So if someone goofed all those years ago when they gm'd the tomatoes the first time and removed the taste and the sweetness - then I think it is way past time that that mistake was recitified.  Please do it before I leave this earth.  I would love to taste a proper tomato once more. ",Don't know/ not sure,I'm not familiar with sugar beets so I don't feel I can make a reasonable comment on that.  If I understand what you're asking - you want to use the sweetness gene from a sugar beet and put that into a tomato?  Are they compatible?  Wouldn't that make the tomato just sweet?  What about the missing flavor from the tomatoes of today?  It was flavor and sweetness that was lost.  Sweet alone won't cut it.  You need the proper flavor back to make it a proper tomato again.  For this one I am going to have to go with Don't know/not sure.  I need more information. ,Very comfortable,"Considering the horns are removed surgically and it causes pain & suffering to the cattle, it would make sense to gm them.  No more pain and suffering for the cattle. On a side note - it seems the elephants are doing the same thing on their own with the tusks. The elephants are not growing them anymore. But that is evolution not gm.  No tusks = no poachers killing them. ",Don't know/not sure,The first thing I would have to ask is WHY?  What would be the purpose of increasing the producing capacity of the cows.  If I could be provided with a really good reason - like stopping the surgical horn removal - then I might say ok.  Right at this moment I haven't been given a reason so I will have to state that I Don't know/not sure. ,Very comfortable,I know alot of people are against genetically modified anything.  But we humans have modified our world - in a bad way - so the science people have to modify our food products to allow them to thrive in a world that was never meant to be like this.  Basically I feel quit mucking around with the world and nobody will gm the food.  But if you want to eat - food has to grow - world is changing so the food has to change to thrive. ,Very comfortable,See previous answer regarding the wheat.  Wheat or blueberries - a crop is a crop. ,Don't know/not sure,The way we humans have mucked up this beautiful world is a crying shame.  But because we have mucked it up I know that we have to do something with the crops in order to keep eating. I know as a child with our family back-yard garden we did use pesticides to keep the bugs away and to get rid of the ones that we had.  Pesticides are not good for you.  Everyone knows that. Will gene-edited food affect the human bodly? We don't know?  Right off the bat I would have gone with the first choice of increased production and decreased pesticides.  But then I get to the bottom of the question and I get two other options which have me scratching my head. Is there another way to avoid pesticide use?  And then the real kicker - about who owns or controls these technologies.  I'm sorry to say that once again I'm going to have to go with Don't know/not sure.  ,Don't know/not sure,"The basic facts are that humans are a greedy, self-serving, selfish species.  Oh don't get me wrong there are some good ones out there that are trying very hard to preserve forests and biodiversity.  But you know as well as I do that huge amounts of wildlife habitats are lost every day to human agriculture.  So let's say we pick number one - increase of production of ge crops in exchange for large improvements to biodiversity.  Do you honestly think that a greedy corporation would go for that?  Now just pulling numbers here out of a hat.  With wheat - an acre of wheat (regular not gm'd) might feed what 10 people. But gm the wheat and that same acre might feed 1,000.  Now you want those corporations to stay on that one little acre of land.  They will say no way we will expand - and to hell with the wildlife and such like. If we can feed 1,000 people from 1 acre think what we can do with a million acres.  I would love to answer the first choice but my believe in human kindness concerning animal welfare is a little on the low side.  So I will once again say Don't know/not sure.

Genetic modification requires the knowledge and presence of a complete gene to splice into a genome, introducing a particular trait that isn't there, while editing seems more useful for ""fixing"" something that seems like a problem (while the gene that is there is quite similar to the target structure). I suppose gene drives can be used in either case, but represents an intention to modify a population as opposed to an individual organism.",Very uncomfortable,This goes to far in the direction of Frankenstein.

Additionally since Canada exports much of its wheat we have to consider what effects having a GM wheat would have on our markets. Traditional crop breeding techniques have been quite successful in altering traits and I know that plant breeders already address these issues in their programs.  I am not adverse to genetic modification per se but for wheat it seems this type has some downfalls.,Comfortable,Since blueberries are less likely to be a significant export crop this doesn't bother me as much as with wheat.,"A large increase in production of gene-edited crops in exchange for a large decrease in pesticide use
 ",As a bird watcher I am aware that beneficial insects and birds are in decline due to pesticide use so I support using less pesticides and I do see GM as one way of achieving that.

Agree,Agree,Disagree,Somewhat different,"Modification is adding something that doesn't belong - like a fish gene in a plant.
Editing would be removing an undesirable characteristic, while leaving everything else the same.  Or, it might facilitate more of an existing desirable trait to blossom or dominate.
Drives would prevent one having to make the modification each and every time one wanted to have a result - e.g., mules are very useful but they can't reproduce themselves so creating them is too much work and takes too much time.",Very comfortable,"It's actually a step ""backwards"" towards the original.   
Commercial tomatoes are more of a ""franken-tomato"" than the proposed edited one - an unnatural shape and unnatural sweetness and flavour.   The edited one would only have one ""deviation""",Uncomfortable,"I am uncomfortable with this approach NOT because I feel afraid of ""attack of the killer tomatoes"".
I would fear dollars dictating that only tomatoes anyone would grow commercially would be the super-sweet beet-gened ones since we simply can't be obese enough.   So it depends on what is done with the old genetics and with tomatoes that taste like tomatoes and not sugared fruit. ",Comfortable,"The only downside I can see is an inevitable loss of the original genetics - the creation of a mono-culture - because  the ""need"" to do it is dollars.  Saving the animals from the pain of surgery is how we rationalize and justify it after the fact but it's not the real reason.    Whenever man goes whole-hog into mono-culture, the benefits are usually short term with problems later.    When human civilization collapses and dairy cattle are no longer kept safe and fed in fenced fields and barns,they won't be able to defend themselves without horns and will get wiped out.   We need to keep some herds with original genomes around, just in case.",Comfortable,"Assuming this meant taking a cow gene from one variety and inserting it into another to create a third variety - e.g. taking a Guernsey gene and putting it into a Holstein to get a Holstein's daily production with a Guernsey's butter fat levels.  Seems worthwhile as long as feed conversion improves too.  By that I mean, if 2 Guernseys produced the same amount of profit as one Holstein, I'd rather have the two Guernseys to deal with than one giant Holstein.",Uncomfortable,"If the author of the question didn't have his own doubt about doing this, he would have named the other plant species and explained what the spliced gene did. 
Anytime something is not clearly and thoroughly labelled, I know someone is trying to hide something from me and, therefore, I oppose it on principle.",Uncomfortable,"Commercial importance is NOT the issue.
We are putting the stuff into our bodies.  There is NO difference that can be justified by ""importance"".  A very specious argument.
Again I say, anytime something is not clearly and thoroughly labelled, I know someone is trying to hide something from me and, therefore, I oppose it on principle.",I prefer not to answer this question because it doesn't discuss other ways of avoiding pesticide use,"Again it's about money and not what we put into our bodies.  If a plant is resistant to pests it is because it produces ""natural"" poisons.  If they can harm pests, they can harm me.   Without knowing what the poison produced by the plants is, I can't assess whether it's worse to eat plants with built in poisons (which can't be washed off) - vs - plants that have mad-made poisons sprayed on.  Just because a poison isn't ""natural"" doesn't preclude it from being less harmful than ""natural"" poisons.   
I don't care who owns technology if it's good technology that doesn't harm me.  If they can give me safe food I'm glad they can make money too.   But when they can't or won't  fully label and disclose, I have to say again - anytime something is not clearly and thoroughly labelled, I know someone is trying to hide something from me and, therefore, I oppose it on principle.","A large increase in production of gene-edited crops in exchange for large improvements to biodiversity

Strongly agree,Neutral,Strongly disagree,Somewhat similar,"All of these have the potential for creating unwanted, or potentially dangerous or harmful mutations in an existing genome. The context of ""editing"" versus modification, only appears to be slightly different in that it does not specify if the changes are the result of material from an external organism. That is, by this definition an edit could be a removal of, or some other alteration of the genetic sequence without introduction of foreign material, but it also does not preclude foreign DNA, just that it is ""targeted"" toward a specific result. The context of the gene drive is a logical extension of either technique, since propagation of the desired trait or mutation is the reason to make the alteration in the first place - that is, to insure that the changes create offspring with the desired trait. To the extent that these offspring supplant and replace an entire population-rather than resulting in a distinct new species with the desired trait, makes this a rather radical idea. ",Very uncomfortable,"I am not sure of the logic or value of the process. If the supermarket tomato has been selectively bred for cosmetic reasons but taste is lacking, then it is a matter for the consumer to determine if the ""heirloom"" tomato's superior flavor is worth the ""ugliness"". If however other characteristics were what was selected for in creation of the ""supermarket"" tomato, then the flavor profile ought to be achievable by further selective breeding instead of ""scissors"". ",Very uncomfortable,"This goes back to my original premise. If you add genes from a different species - in fact a different genus, you are creating something that is no longer a tomato. It is a new thing that has not existed, has not evolved, and could potentially be harmful, or, if propagated to future crops, mutate into something harmful. ",Very uncomfortable,"This entire premise is fallacious. Beef cattle do in fact have horns. Most beef grown here in Texas are from Angus, Brahma, or Longhorn variety of the cow, all of which have prominent horns. Horns are part of the genetic heritage of the bovine group, and this is reflected in their wild relations such as buffalo, bison, wildabeast, and muskox. In any case, I am not motivated by the fact that a long standing and effective procedure to remove the horns is creating ""pain and suffering"" anymore than an automated milking machine is. ",Very uncomfortable,"I don't feel that genetic manipulation beyond selective breeding is EVER a good idea, because I don't believe our scientific understanding of potentially harmful side effects is sufficient to do it. Let's suppose that this is done. For 50 or 100 years we get good milk producing cattle, then some mutation occurs in the environment which results in a virus wiping out these wonder-cows because the genetic change destroyed an innate immunity. And in 50 or 100 years all the pre-wonder-cows have died off because they weren't commercially viable, so now we have no cows at all. This is the problem I have with the entire context of genetic manipulation. ",Very uncomfortable,"I am a great supporter of selectively breeding for hardier crops, crops that fair better in certain soils, climates, or other ecosystemic considerations. However, the introduction of new genetic material from something that is not wheat means that the resulting organism IS NOT wheat. While such a forced alteration may be benign, it is equally possible that it can be a lethal issue in the long term. Wheat, even though it has been selectively bred for several thousand years, is the result of long natural evolution along with our species. Introducing a non-natural change in that genetic structure has the potential to cause problems with our species since we did not evolve with that genetic structure. ",Very uncomfortable,"The reasoning is the same as before. Creating something which did not evolve naturally or come about by selective breeding creates a product which is not genetically harmonious with the species that is consuming it. While it can be tested in the near term, it is difficult, if not impossible, to evaluate the long term effects because a direct causal link may not appear for decades or longer. ",I prefer not to answer this question because it doesn't discuss other ways of avoiding pesticide use,"I believe that the increase in pesticide use is related to many factors, including profitability, corporate farming models, and the reduction in natural predation of pest due to the predators being wiped out by pesticides. The pests eat the crops for the same reason people do. If you grow a plant that the bug doesn't want to eat, you may find the human can't eat it either. ",I prefer not to answer this question because it doesn't discuss other ways of conserving biodiversity,"To argue for the need for biodiversity while at the same time creating artificial species is extremely fallacious. Biodiversity is the natural outcome of long-term evolutionary adaptation. Agriculturally produced domestic species already threaten such adaptation. To create something that has not come about from that environment because it ""might"" mean smaller amounts of the environment be given over to agriculture seems poorly considered.

Agree,Agree,Disagree,Somewhat different,"While all processes involve some type of modification, the end results desired are different.",Comfortable,This told me where the genes were coming from - in this case - heirloom tomato plants.

The idea of using an identified, natural plant gene to improve another plant is fascinating.  ",Neither comfortable nor uncomfortable,"While I understand the logic and need for the process, I dislike the thought of altering animals.  While I'd rather know they are altered instead of suffering through surgery,  I see both good and bad sides to the process.  The editing could eventually make dairy cattle easier to breed and farm, but what if a 'bad' gene is used?  How would that affect the cattle population?  ",Neither comfortable nor uncomfortable,I see both positive and negative aspects.  Yes - cows will produce more milk which will feed the population of the world and generate income for farmers and dairy manufacturing.  I also want to know the animal rights are going to be protected and they will not be over-producing milk for profit.  Will there be guarantees in place to protect the animals?,Neither comfortable nor uncomfortable,"The purpose for modification is understood, but there was no mention of the type of plant used to modify the wheat.

",Don't know/not sure,"The concept is clear but no mention was made of what else might be done with the land.  The explanation mentions forest habitat, but in this area, there are buildings going up everywhere.  This used to be a suburban area and now it's becoming urban.

 ","I have a story that explains my answer. I took marketing courses (in Burnaby BC) during the early 90's with an ex-director of the McDonald company in Canada. He told us in the course that the McDonald Co. used to purchase its potatoes from Idaho farmers who didn't use pesticides because their potatoes were genetically modified. After ""Frankenfoods"" protests from ""activists"", the company reverted its stance and the farmers had to go back to pesticide-grown crops.

",Comfortable,If it is the sweetness gene from the sugar beet is inserted into the genome then it should be sweetness only that will improve the Supermarket tomato variety.,Comfortable,Two actions are being applied - gene editing and gene guide...I think that the edit to get hornless dairy cows. The gene guide is making sure that hornless dairy cows continue so that gene editing is avoided each time cows are bred. I think the end result is acceptable.,Uncomfortable,I am unsure if you edit the gene as well as gene guide if some other mechanism would not also be effected given the effect hormones can have on milk production.
