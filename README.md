# Survey on public perceptions of gene editing in agriculture for Genome British Columbia

This repository includes the (anonymized) data and code used to write a chapter of my PhD thesis, and which is also a manuscript currently in preparation.

The survey was programmed using Qualtrics, distributed via Dynata to a sample of US and Canadian publics, and analyzed using R. It aimed to explore: How do publics
feel about new gene editing technologies in agriculture? Are they uncomfortable with specific applications of them, and what might motivate (dis)comfort? How do
people respond to these applications when they are presented in the context of specific tradeoffs, and to what extent do participants prefer to opt out entirely of
expressing opinions on this topic (and why?)

Design of this survey was influenced by [previous focus groups and interviews](https://github.com/sara-nawaz/Gene-editing-Q-method), which  served as the basis for another chapter of my PhD thesis as well as a manuscript currently under review.

A few notes on code: This project was a steep learning curve for me, so the code is very messy (!). I plan to go back and clean up my code when I have the time, but
I haven't done this yet, so reader beware. Also, there are two versions of the R script that I uploaded--I included the earlier one because it contains the factor
analysis, which is not included in the later analysis.
