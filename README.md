# Survey on public perceptions of gene editing in agriculture for Genome British Columbia

This repository includes the (anonymized) data and code used to write a chapter of my PhD thesis, and which is also a manuscript currently in preparation.

The survey was programmed using Qualtrics, distributed via Dynata to a sample of US and Canadian publics, and analyzed using R.
